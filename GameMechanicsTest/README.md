# ALPHA

This is our alpha version, meaning that there are some things that are polished and some that are not, here is a list

POLISHED:
- simple gameplay mechanics: walk, jump, climb
- a funcitoning level editor via excel
- some proof of concept levels, showing our working game mechanics

SEMI-POLISHED / FUNCTIONAL:
- animations - some animations (most of the imporatant ones) are in place and functional, but a couple are missing and more will be added with new levels/obstacles
- artwork - we have some textures implemented, but more will need to be added to improve visual appeal / clarity

NOT POLISHED / TO BE IMPLEMENTED:
- creative level design - this is the thing that will be worked on the most in between the alpha and the beta, will include
    - making levels more challenging 
    - adding custom "gimmicks" (Ice, falling snow, turrets, ect... ) to make the levels more unique
    - adding artwork backrounds to make the levels visually appealing
