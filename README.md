- You progress in the game by moving up screens. Essentially, each screen you goal is to get to the top of the screen and then get to the next one via either jumping or climbing
- Darker Gray Squares are walls / Floors, they have full collision
- Lighter Gray squares are Climbable, use q to latch onto them
- various other colored squares work as other fun things, have fun finding them out!
- This game is not meant to be easy and is meant to induce annoyance, look up foddian game to see more


# ALPHA

This is our alpha version, meaning that there are some things that are polished and some that are not, here is a list

POLISHED:
- simple gameplay mechanics: walk, jump, climb
- a funcitoning level editor via excel: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aajrhPuxYBjG1hCwqYjwBfMf7LxzwI5n02Gsq4F0JYE/edit?usp=sharing 
- some proof of concept levels, showing our working game mechanics

SEMI-POLISHED / FUNCTIONAL:
- animations - some animations (most of the imporatant ones) are in place and functional, but a couple are missing and more will be added with new levels/obstacles
- artwork - we have some textures implemented, but more will need to be added to improve visual appeal / clarity

NOT POLISHED / TO BE IMPLEMENTED:
- creative level design - this is the thing that will be worked on the most in between the alpha and the beta, will include
    - making levels more challenging 
    - adding custom "gimmicks" (Ice, falling snow, turrets, ect... ) to make the levels more unique
    - adding artwork backrounds to make the levels visually appealing
    - Collectables with counter displayed on screen
