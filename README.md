# ALPHA

This is our alpha version, meaning that there are some things that are polished and some that are not, here is a list

POLISHED:
- simple gameplay mechanics: walk, jump, climb
- a functioning level editor via Excel: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aajrhPuxYBjG1hCwqYjwBfMf7LxzwI5n02Gsq4F0JYE/edit?usp=sharing 
- some proof of concept levels, showing our working game mechanics

SEMI-POLISHED / FUNCTIONAL:
- animations - some animations (most of the important ones) are in place and functional, but a couple are missing and more will be added with new levels/obstacles
- artwork - we have some textures implemented, but more will need to be added to improve visual appeal / clarity

NOT POLISHED / TO BE IMPLEMENTED:
- creative level design - this is the thing that will be worked on the most in between the alpha and the beta, will include
    - making levels more challenging 
    - adding custom "gimmicks" (Ice, falling snow, turrets, ect... ) to make the levels more unique
    - adding artwork backgrounds to make the levels visually appealing
    - Collectables with counter displayed on screen
