# OVERVIEW
This is a foddian style 2D platformer made in java swing by
- Henry Barasanti
- Matthew Murawski
- Anthony Russo
- Charlie Wells

to run the game, run the file Main.java


# BASIC CONTROLS

W - Jump
A - Move left
D - Move right
S- fall fast while in air
Q - Toggle to climbing mode over climbable surface
E - Toggle to release climbing

# TIPS
- You progress in the game by moving up screens. Essentially, for each screen your goal is to get to the top of the screen and then get to the next one via either jumping or climbing
- Concrete/Rocky Squares are walls / floors, they have full collision
- Cobblestones / vibrant icy squares and climbable, press q to grab onto them and the player will start climbing
- various other colored squares work as other fun things, have fun finding them out!
- This game is not meant to be easy and is meant to induce moderate annoyance, look up foddian style game to see more
- The game is beatable (Matt did it), but is difficult, it will likely take over an hour on your first attempt
- utilize the s to fall faster, it makes the game significantly easier

# BETA

This is our beta version, meaning that most of our game is polished, but there is still some room for improvement

POLISHED:
- simple gameplay mechanics: walk, jump, climb
- a functioning level editor via Excel: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aajrhPuxYBjG1hCwqYjwBfMf7LxzwI5n02Gsq4F0JYE/edit?usp=sharing 
- 12 clean, fun, and playable levels
- animations - all animations complete
- artwork - all levels have artwork
- creative level design
    - made levels challenging
    - added custom "gimmicks" (Ice, falling snow, turrets, ect... ) to make the levels more unique, here is a list of some of them
        - Bouncer
        - Trapper
        - Ice
        - Wind
    - added artwork backgrounds to make the levels visually appealing

ROOM FOR GROWTH:
- making a functioning menu with a tutorial to replace this screen: we got one halfway working, but decided to scrap it for this version
- adding a more satisfying ending to the game: for the full release of this game, this would be nessicary, but it is a lot of work that is kind of seperate from the main project, so we held off
- audio implementation: this was started, but was never fully implemented due to time constraints
- more levels / things to add to those levels
